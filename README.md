# Digit Classification Model

The objective of this project is to develop a robust digit classification model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits. The model is trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning.
## Dataset

The MNIST dataset comprises numerical arrays of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each sized at 28x28 pixels. It is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).
